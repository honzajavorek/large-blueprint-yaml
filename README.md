# Large Blueprint YAML

Code I used for generating a large YAML structure from an API Blueprint. Useful for all sorts of testing and debugging.

The blueprint is made by concatenating multiple rather large blueprints so it simulates real structures. Used Blueprints [were found on GitHub](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=POST+extension%3Aapib+size%3A%3E300000&type=Code&ref=searchresults), so they were published by their owners and no private data of Apiary customers are disclosed by this repo.

## Usage

To create YAML file:

```bash
$ make
```

To remove YAML file:

```bash
$ make clean
```
